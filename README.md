###### The interface for the game.

Each day, a new puzzle appears. The center letter is in yellow and must be used. The rest of the letters may or may not be used. The goal is to create words using the center letter and the outer letters. All letters can be repeated.

The script is run by calling `python spell -c <CENTER LETTER> -ol <OUTER LETTER LIST>`
